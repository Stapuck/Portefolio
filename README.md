# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


# Project Description :

This project has 2 purposes, first learning React and then having a Portefolio for my professional (and athlete) career.


# find a good name 

this project will contain some features : 

- download of document, 
- timeline,
- carroussel and gallery,
- video,
- contact form,
- ,
- ,
- ,






# Project Version :

you will find in here, the differente version of the project and what does it mean, what specifics changes have been done between two versions. 

I am personally committed to a policy of non-regression throughout the entire project. So if a module disappear, it's because it wasn't usefull.

N.B : if you have any Tips/Advices to integrate better practice or to improve my code, let me know !!!
